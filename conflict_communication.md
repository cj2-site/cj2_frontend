## Communication Plan

###Workflow###

* All team members should work ONLY branches and NEVER on master.
* Branch names should include initial first then feature.
* Commit messages should be descriptive.
* Include descriptive comments if necessary.
* Code: spacing and comments, standardize this for team
* Work 9am - 5pm weekdays.  Let team know if any personal issues come in the way of working together or if WFH required.
* Work after hours will only push branch and create pull request. Discuss the next day before merge. Will try to work in pairs and review PR for others promptly.

###How will you communicate during the week daytime?###

* Have a stand up in the morning and afternoon around 1500-ish.

###How will you communicate after hours?###
* We will use our Chime private group.

###What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?###

* Ensure everyone has room to talk. 
* Ask everyone by name what they think.

###How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?###
* All ideas will have space to be heard. 
* Avoid non-constructive criticisms of ideas. 
* Adding the question: "how are you feeling?" during twice daily check-ins.

## Conflict Plan

###What will your group do when it encounters conflict?###

1. identify that conflict has arisen
2. laptops down for everyone
3. identify the feelings behind the conflict
4. come to a solution that makes everyone happy

###How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?###

* During a daily stand-up in our group, looks at blocks and check-in about individual progress
* Speak to them privately and find if there are blockers that are private / sensitive issues
* Offer to pair program
* After lunch check-in to discuss blockers and goals for the afternoon

###What is your process to resolve conflicts?###

* If there is no majority vote, the group will go to the TA or teacher for discussion.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
* If we can't complete step 4 within 30 minutes, we will bring issue to a TA or Prof.
